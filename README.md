# sentiment-analysis-and-topic-modeling-for-COVID-19-tweets
This current study aims to evaluate the topics and opinions of COVID-19 discussion found on Twitter. It performed topic modeling and sentiment analysis of tweets posted during late 2020 and early 2021. It is expected to find if there are any new emotional patterns or trends compared to previous research.

## Installation 
Gensim package:
`!pip install --upgrade gensim==3.7.0`  
Mallet 2.0.8 package for LDA algorithm:
`!wget http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/dist/mallet-2.0.8.zip`  
`!unzip mallet-2.0.8.zip`  
Visulization with plotly:
`!pip install --upgrade plotly==5.2.1`  

## Process
1. Data collection
2. Data preparation
3. Sentiment analysis. Lexicon-based / supervised learning sentiment classifiers were trained and evaluated with Sentiment140 dataset. The sentiment classifier with the best performance would then be applied to the COVID-19 tweet dataset and assign a sentiment score (or label), either -1 for “negative” or 1 for “positive”, to each of the tweets. 
4. Topic modeling. We tested various LDA models with distant pooling schemes and different numbers of topics as an input parameter. The topics generated by the LDA model with the best quality were then interpreted to get insights of the issues of interest during the studied period of the COVID-19 pandemic.
5. Topic-based sentiment analysis. For each of the topics, we adopted the VADER lexicon-based algorithm (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014) to compute the sentiment score so that the opinionated themes can be identified. 
6. Regional analysis. As part of the tweet data contains geographic information, the local sentiment and topics were analyzed with a focus on the main areas of origins of the tweets.
